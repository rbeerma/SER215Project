SER 215 Final Project (Blackjack game)

The initial committed code is the shell GUI that we will be working in.
The majority of the game logic should be placed inside the actionPerformed() methods of each of the button listeners, since every event in the game is driven by button clicks and the current state of the game.

You can change/remove anything that already exists in the listeners, which right now is just changes to the enabled state of some of the buttons. These basic controls are pretty intuitive, but if you're unclear how the listeners work, before you change/remove anything, go ahead and run the program and click on some buttons and follow along with the code so you can decipher what each like of code equates to.

Also, right now, I'm painting a few card images to the table in the TablePanel class. Those are just placeholders for now, while I figured out how to get the images to show up and position them, so you can remove/comment out the lines that draw the images if you need to do something else that conflicts.

Have fun and let me know if you have any troubles pulling down the code, getting it setup in Eclipse, etc. Oh, and a quick reminder that you may want to install the WindowBuilder plugin for Eclipse if you haven't already. If you're unfamiliar, just go to Help > Install New Software and put in this URL: http://download.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/WB/release/R201506241200-1/4.5/
